# AsTeR

AsTeR is an opensource platform for collecting, analyzing and prioritizing information during natural disasters. We help first responders make the most of limited resources so they can save as many lives as possible.

AsTeR collects information during natural disasters and makes it readily available for emergency centers. AsTeR develops a variety of services to analyze various types of data, from emergency calls to satellite images and social media. Each service constitutes its own repo within the [Project AsTeR organisation](https://github.com/Project-AsTeR). This [aster repositiory](https://github.com/Project-AsTeR/aster/) combines all of AsTeR's services into a single platform which can be used by first responders during natural disasters.
