# Contributing guidelines

## Welcome to AsTeR!

Thank you for considering contributing to Project AsTeR. It's people like you that make Project AsTeR a reality for first responders across the globe.

## How to contribute code

### Pull requests and issues
If you have improvements for the AsTeR platform, send us your pull requests! If you're new to GitHub, here is [how to do it](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

AsTeR team members will review your pull request. Once the pull request gets approved and passes continuous integration test, an AsTeR team member will merge your change internally before merging your pull request on GitHub.

If you want to contribute but don't know where to start, navigate to the [GitHub issues tab](https://github.com/Project-AsTeR/aster/issues) and look for something of interest to you. Once you've found an issue you want to contribute to, leave a comment to let others know you are working on it. If you want to collaborate with other users, use the issue comment thread to coordinate.

### Contribution guidelines and standards

*  Include unit tests when you contribute new features. This will help prove your code works as intended and guards against future breaking    changes.
*  If you are fixing a bug, consider adding a unit test that will catch this bug in the future.

## How to contribute project ideas

Natural disasters can affect many aspects of our lives. If you have an idea that could help AsTeR collect more information during natural disasters, send us an email at aster.messages@gmail.com. A team member will be in contact with you to help frame the project and decide how to best make it match with the AsTeR platform as a whole. If the service proposal is accepted, we will create a new repo for developers to help build it. Depending on your objectives and motivations, you may take an active leadership role in the development of that service. If you just want to suggest your idea and let AsTeR do the rest, that is fine as well.
